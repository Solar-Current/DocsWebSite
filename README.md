## CoopBoss Update
On June 30, 2021 SmartThings is shutting down support for the SmartThings Hub (2013) 6. This hub is how the CoopBoss communicates with the SmartThings IOS and Android apps. You will no longer be able to control the CoopBoss with these apps. After June 30, 2021 you should still be ale to open and close the coop door with the physical button connected to the CoopBoss. The CoopBoss has a built in light sensor that is used to automatically open and close the coop door. If this is enabled it should continue to work after the hub is shutdown.

See [community.smartthings.com]()https://community.smartthings.com/t/coopboss-is-certified-chicken-coop-door-controller-for-smartthings/49873/49 for more infromation on the SmartThings shutdown.
